# README: Merge Conflicts

We are resolving merge conflicts like a boss today. This code was started on desktop and added to github after.

## Steps to Resolve Conflicts

1. Edit code in remote
2. Edit code on local (do not pull first)
3. push code from local to remote
4. AAH CONFLICT --> run `git pull`
5. Select which code you want to - use
6. push changes (identify that you're resolving a conflict and what the conflict was over, be brief)
